		<span style="color:#FA82AA;">Synopsis: </span>When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, 
		started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions 
		of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To 
		combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: 
		massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously 
		by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even 
		the Jaegers are proving nearly defenceless in the face of the relentless 
		Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice 
		but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot 
		(Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are 
		teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. 
		Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.
